Zillow is an online real estate website that help home owners to buy, sell and rent homes.

**Model 1:** The first model was modeling using square feet of living as the only paremeter. <br>
**That reuslted in a relationship of a base cost of 260,974 and for every square foot, expected an increase in 355 which accounted for 36.2% of the variance** <br>
**Model 2:** The second model added grade, which was the second highest correlation, along side square feet of living  <br>
**The base cost of -626890 for any given house. For every square foot increase the price by $231 while for ever grade increased the price by $150702. The model explains 41.8% of the variance.
